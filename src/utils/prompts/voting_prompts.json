Based on these images, please assess whether this task can be completed successfully.\n\nAssessment criteria:\n1. Are all required objects present in the scene?\n2. Is there sufficient free space on the target platform for placement?\n3. Are the spatial relationships between objects as required by the task achievable?\n4. Would completing the task create any unstable or physically impossible arrangements?\n\nPlease only output a single line: \"Feasible\", \"Partially feasible\", or \"Not feasible\" based on the task's feasibility.\n\nExplanation is not required.\n\nThis task involves the following platforms and multilayer objects:\n\nplatform: {platform_name}\nmultilayer object: {multilayer_object_name}\n\nTheir pictures are as follows:"
